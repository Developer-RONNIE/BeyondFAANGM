# STEPS TO PERFORM

1.   Check this [website](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) to find the right place for the company you want to add.  

1.   Add the company STRICTLY in the increasing alphabetical order. See this small [article](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid).  

1.   Please don't add the numbering in logical order. Keep every number equal to ```1```. Markdown handles the numbering on its own.  

1.  If somehow you make the numbering not according to the point number ```5```. it will make a conflict while merging PR.
